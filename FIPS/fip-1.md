# FIP 001: Introduction

## What is a FIP?

FIP stands for Fuse Improvement Proposal.
A FIP is a design document providing information to the Fuse community, or describing a new feature for Fuse Network.
The FIP should provide motivation and technical specification for the feature.

## FIP format

A FIP should contain the following sections:
* Motivation - why this FIP is needed, what is the rationale behind it
* Suggestion - how this FIP intends to achieve the goal described in the motivation section
* Examples - how this FIP should work in real life
* Implementation (or Future Work) - what needs to be done in order for this FIP to be implemented
* Additional info - things that need to be discussed, or more thought is needed on

## FIP discussion

Each FIP will have a dedicated issue open for it [here](https://github.com/fuseio/FIPs/issues).

See (FIP-1 issue)[https://github.com/fuseio/FIPs/issues/1] as an example.

## FIP open for voting

A FIP which is changing consensus related implementation on the Fuse network should be opened for voting as described [here](https://docs.fuse.io/the-fuse-chain/consensus-contracts/vote).

## FIP acceptance

A FIP is considered as accepted once itâ€™s implemented technically and voted on by network consensus stakeholders (validators). 
The pull request implementing the FIP should refer to it as well as the vote opened on the Fuse network.
